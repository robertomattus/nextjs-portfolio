                        I&#39;m a Full-Stack software developer. Although I&#39;m more focused on bakcend development. <br />
                        I have the necessary skills to face the biggest challenges and the determination to solve each one that comes in my way. <br />
                        <br />
                        I have experience using some languages â€‹and frameworks as an individual developer.<br /> (Frontend development). <br />
                        <br />
                        I also have experience creating APIs with NodeJS, postgreSQL and certain dependencies... Those projects 
                        include security. I can also create desktop apps with Java.
